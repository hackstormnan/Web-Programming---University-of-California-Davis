Initiated the creation of a personal website, where I harnessed a range of web technologies to offer an engaging user experience. This interactive platform facilitates effortless image uploads, message composition, and real-time generation of personalized postcards, showcasing a synergy of user-driven content.

Meticulously crafting the user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enabled users to customize their postcards by selecting color palettes, fonts, and applying subtle CSS/JS touches. By effectively integrating database capabilities, I streamlined data storage, exemplifying an approach that values both functionality and user-centricity.

This project reflects my commitment to utilizing diverse technologies to craft meaningful digital solutions.
