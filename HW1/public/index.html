      During the late 1960s, after graduating from UC Davis (BA, 1966; MA, 1967)
      and moving to New York, Stephen Kaltenbach established a reputation in the
      emerging international field of Conceptual art. But in 1970, just as he
      was achieving career success, Kaltenbach abruptly withdrew to California’s
      Central Valley, appearing to abandon Conceptual work in favor of the more
      traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. Coinciding with the 50th
      anniversary of his “dropout,” this exhibition considers Kaltenbach’s
      engagement with time as a principal theme across his remarkably diverse
      career, which encompasses bronze time capsules, advertisements placed
      anonymously in Artforum magazine in 1968-69, and the monumental
      photorealist painting Portrait of My Father (1972-79)
